# Pokemon App
This is a simple web application that shows pokemon and their images, abilities, and base statistics. I made this to practice React and Redux
I followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbAENvrGbDo) tutorial. The project in the video was done in React V5 I believe, so I had to make some changes for React V6.

# Technologies used
